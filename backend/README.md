### Running the application with docker:
```shell
docker compose --env-file .app.env up --build 
```

<hr>

### Application Ð¡onfigurations:
These configurations are passed to the env file at
the root of the backend application, i.e. '/backend'.
On startup they are applied to the application.
```text 
configurations, often they will not need to be changed.

 Enable internal exceptions, you can pass both options true/false.
 If 'true', then when a 500 server error occurs,
 notification will be sent to the admin's mail with the error log.

APP_JWT_SECRET=some_jwt_secret (
 The secret key of jwt tokens, which will be used to encrypt the tokens,
 is the secret key, keep it safe. But in case you change it,
 all current user sessions will be rejected and they will need to log in again.
 A safe key can be generated with this command: < python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))" >.

you can get it from your email domain's website.

### To run the application directly without docker.
- activate virtual environments.
- Before starting the web application itself you need
to start the services that are written in the docker-compose file,
the best way to do this is through a container:
```shell
docker compose --env-file .app.env up postgres -d --build
docker compose --env-file .app.env up redis -d --build
```
- change the _launch_option parameter 
in the cofiugrations to "local":
```python
    class _Config(_BaseSettings):
        _launch_option = "local"
```
- uncomment the line in main.py file:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    from .settings import config

    uvicorn.run(
        "app.main:fastapi_app",
        host="0.0.0.0",  # noqa: S104 (this interface is only available on the closed docker network)
        port=config.app_port,
        reload=True,
    )
```
- Since you are running the application directly without 
the described rules in the docker image python application,
you should apply migrations:
```shell
alembic upgrade head
```
- Then run the main.py file from root dir '/backend':
```shell
python -m app.main
```

<hr>

If any changes have been made to the table models in the database,
use migrations for generation and application:
```shell
alembic revision --autogenerate
alembic upgrade head
```
<hr>

Before committing, use a bash script to check
the modified code for any errors and formating.
Before running the script, give it executable permissions:
```shell
  chmod +x pre-commit.sh
  ```
```shell
  ./pre-commit.sh
  ```
